# During the build about 4.5G are needed, but the final image will be about 3.5G.
# 2G are generated by 'make' and 'make doc' in lilypond source repository.
# A GUB build may take up to 20G, so 25G seems like a reasonable size.
# The zip compressed image will be below 2G.
RootSize=25G
# This allows to use a small amount of the host RAM.
