The images are built using [mkosi](https://github.com/systemd/mkosi/).
mkosi required version is 5 or later.

If your distro has an older version, you should install it from source.
Dependencies are listed on mkosi README.
Python 3.6 is needed for mkosi 5.

Then download the repository and run the installation:

    git clone git@github.com:systemd/mkosi.git
    cd mkosi
    sudo python3 setup.py install

Usage is printed with this command:

    mkosi --help

The commands used to build the images are in the Makefile.
