Changes:

- New Docker container based on Ubuntu 18.04: download this repository and

  (Fedora images, upgraded to version 29, can still be generated
  using the Makefile)
- The Debian virtual machine is now using the XFCE desktop environment.
- Debian images have all the dependencies to run GUB.

- Added all dependencies needed to build LilyPond without
  any warning: extractpdfmark, URW-35 OpenType font
  files (thanks to @karlinhigh).
- GUI apps can now be run from the container out of the
  box. This is based on a couple of assumptions, which
  should be correct most of the times (see the README).
